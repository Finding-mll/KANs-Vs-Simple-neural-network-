# Neural Network Racing with kANs

This project demonstrates two cars racing against each other on a defined path, each controlled by a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (kAN).

## Features
- Two distinct cars with individual kAN neural networks.
- Simple path with starting and ending points.
- Redesigned car structures and appearances.

## Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Run the Simulation**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Customization
- Modify `car.py` to change car dynamics.
- Adjust `kan_network.py` for different kAN behavior.
- Change path layout in `path.py`.

## Future Plans
- Add more racing tracks.
- Improve kAN algorithms.
